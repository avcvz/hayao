Adapted from Miyazaki’s own manga, it presented a post-apocalyptic world where a young princess, Nausicaä, fights to keep her nation and its rival from going to war over an ancient technology that could destroy both.

Young villager, Pazu, meets a girl named Sheeta when she falls from the sky and lands on his lap; the two learned that her pendant could unlock untold secrets within the “castle in the sky.” The same with “Nausicaä," the young and innocent must grapple against the machinations of cynical adults, who only have eyes for the city’s war machines.

The film’s crammed with the kind of quirky, Byzantine delights you might find in one of Roald Dahl’s books for kids. Miyazaki’s amazing sense of visual invention and his gentle empathy for all his characters, even the “bad” ones, also shine through.

What follows is an epic journey of self-discovery and general badassery in the great Ghibli tradition. It's got all the hallmarks of a Miyazaki movie; strong women, flying machines, air-pirates, and an undertone of the supernatural.
